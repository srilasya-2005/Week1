*Week 1 Submission: Understanding the Project*

### *Project Title:*
Predicting Solar Power Output Using Linear Regression

### *Objective:*
The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate solar power output. By leveraging historical data and analyzing key environmental factors, the model aims to provide insights into energy production trends. This can aid in optimizing solar power resource management and making informed decisions in energy planning.

   - total_cloud_cover_sfc: Total percentage of cloud cover on the surface.
   - high_cloud_cover_high_cld_lay: Percentage of high-altitude cloud cover.
   - medium_cloud_cover_mid_cld_lay: Percentage of medium-altitude cloud cover.
   - low_cloud_cover_low_cld_lay: Percentage of low-altitude cloud cover.

   - wind_direction_80_m_above_gnd: Wind direction at 80 meters.

5. *Target Variable:*
   - generated_power_kw: Solar power output measured in kilowatts (dependent variable).

### *Understanding the Problem Statement:*
The project revolves around understanding the relationship between various environmental factors and the amount of solar power generated. By identifying the most influential variables, the model will predict future solar power output based on the given inputs. This prediction has significant implications in:
- Efficient solar energy planning.
- Reducing reliance on manual forecasting.
- Enhancing renewable energy resource optimization.

### *Approach for the Project:*
The project will be carried out in the following phases:

1. *Data Exploration and Understanding:*
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, outliers, and correlations between features.
   - Understand the role of solar angles, radiation, and weather conditions in influencing power output.

2. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - Handle missing data or anomalies.
   - Normalize or scale features to ensure compatibility for the regression model.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for model validation.

3. *Model Development:*
   - Use linear regression to establish a relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (generated_power_kw).
   - Train the model using a portion of the dataset while preserving a test set for evaluation.

4. *Model Evaluation:*
   - Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted power output to validate accuracy.

5. *Insights and Application:*
   - Interpret the coefficients of the linear regression model to determine the impact of each feature on solar power output.
   - Propose actionable insights for energy planners and resource managers.

### *Key Learnings in Week 1:*
1. Gained an understanding of the dataset, its features, and their significance.
2. Identified the target variable (generated_power_kw) and its relationship to independent variables.
3. Recognized the importance of preprocessing and feature engineering in ensuring model accuracy.
4. Developed a step-by-step plan to approach the project effectively, focusing on linear regression as the predictive model.


### *Conclusion:*
In Week 1, I have developed a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s objectives, dataset structure, and the approach needed to achieve the goal of predicting solar power output. The focus will now shift to EDA and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training and evaluation.
